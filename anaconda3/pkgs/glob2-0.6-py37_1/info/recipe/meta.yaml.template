  summary: Version of the glob module that supports recursion via **, and can capture patterns.
  
  description: |
    The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules 
    used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order. No tilde expansion 
    is done, but *, ?, and character ranges expressed with [] will be correctly matched.
